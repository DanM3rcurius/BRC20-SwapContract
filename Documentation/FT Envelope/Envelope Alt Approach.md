# Alternative envelope approach
#### I asked ChatGPT:
>> Lets say I want to use bitcoin and the taproot capabilities to create a token envelope dedicated to fungible tokens, that is fully compatible with the following standard: https://github.com/bitcoin-computer/monorepo/tree/main/packages/BRC20 

It replied: 
>> I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I'm not able to write code on demand. However, I can provide some guidance on how you might go about creating a Bitcoin token envelope using Taproot capabilities that is compatible with the BRC20 standard.
First, it's important to define the requirements and functionality of the token envelope. Based on the BRC20 standard, the envelope should be able to create new tokens, transfer tokens between addresses, and update the balances correctly.
To achieve this, you can use a smart contract that is designed to hold and manage the tokens. The smart contract can be implemented using a Taproot script that includes the necessary functions to create, transfer, and manage the tokens.
The script might include functions such as:

- `createToken`: Creates a new token with the specified attributes, including a unique identifier, name, symbol, and number of decimal places.
- `transfer`: Transfers a specified amount of tokens from one address to another, updating the balances of both addresses accordingly. The function should also ensure that the sender has sufficient tokens to complete the transfer.
- `balanceOf`: Returns the balance of tokens for a specified address.
- `totalSupply`: Returns the total supply of tokens in circulation.
- `allowance`: Returns the amount of tokens that a specified address is allowed to spend on behalf of another address.
- `approve`: Allows one address to approve another address to spend a specified amount of tokens on their behalf.
These functions would need to be implemented in the Taproot script using OP_CODES and other features of the Bitcoin scripting language.
Once the smart contract has been implemented, you would need to deploy it to the Bitcoin network and test it thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. It's also important to ensure that the smart contract is secure and resistant to attacks.


#### Next I asked to please write the envelope logic in Miniscript with a doubkle spend protection.
It replied:

>>> I can provide an example implementation of a Bitcoin token envelope using Miniscript that includes the functions you mentioned, as well as double spend protection.
Here's an example script that implements the token envelope:

```
IF
  // Check if the transaction input is signed with the correct key
  <Pubkey> CHECKSIGVERIFY

  // Check if the script pubkey matches the provided output script
  <Output Script> EQUALVERIFY
ELSE
  // Check if the transaction input is signed with the correct key
  <Pubkey> CHECKSIGVERIFY

  // Check if the transaction input is spending the correct output
  <Output Script> EQUALVERIFY

  // Check if the transaction input is not spending an already-spent output
  <Spend Protection>

  // Verify that the transfer is valid
  <Transfer Validation>
ENDIF
```

The `<Pubkey>` element refers to the public key that must be used to sign the transaction input. The `<Output Script>` element refers to the script pubkey that must be included in the output being spent.

The `<Spend Protection>` element ensures that the transaction input is not spending an already-spent output. This can be achieved using a double spend protection mechanism such as a nLockTime or a relative time lock.

The `<Transfer Validation>` element includes the functions you mentioned, such as `createToken`, `transfer`, `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, `allowance`, and `approve`. These functions can be implemented using Miniscript OP_CODES and other features of the Bitcoin scripting language.

Here's an example implementation of the `createToken` function:

```
OP_IF
  // Check if the provided attributes are valid
  <Validate Token Attributes>

  // Create a new token with the specified attributes
  <Create New Token>
OP_ELSE
  // If the conditions are not met, fail the script
  <Fail Script>
OP_ENDIF
```

The `<Validate Token Attributes>` element includes checks to ensure that the provided token attributes, such as the unique identifier, name, symbol, and decimal places, are valid and within the required limits.

The `<Create New Token>` element creates a new token with the specified attributes and adds it to the token supply.

Similar implementations can be created for the other functions, such as `transfer`, `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, `allowance`, and `approve`.

## Tests

### Test Cases
1. Test the `createToken` function:
- Provide valid token attributes (unique identifier, name, symbol, decimal places) and a valid public key for signing the transaction input
- Check that a new token is created with the specified attributes and added to the token supply

2. Test the `transfer` function:
- Provide a valid token ID, a valid recipient address, and a valid amount to transfer
- Sign the transaction input with the correct private key and provide the correct output script pubkey
- Check that the transfer is successful and the balances of the sender and recipient are updated accordingly

3. Test the `balanceOf` function:
- Provide a valid token ID and a valid account address
- Check that the balance of the specified account for the specified token is returned correctly

4. Test the `totalSupply` function:
- Provide a valid token ID
- Check that the total supply of the specified token is returned correctly

5. Test the `allowance` function:
- Provide a valid token ID, a valid owner address, and a valid spender address
- Check that the allowance of the specified spender for the specified token by the specified owner is returned correctly

6. Test the `approve` function:
- Provide a valid token ID, a valid spender address, and a valid allowance amount
- Sign the transaction input with the correct private key and provide the correct output script pubkey
- Check that the approval is successful and the allowance of the specified spender for the specified token by the specified owner is updated accordingly

7. Test double spend protection:
- Create a transaction that spends an output that has already been spent by a previous transaction
- Sign the transaction input with the correct private key and provide the correct output script pubkey
- Check that the transaction is rejected due to double spend protection

These are just some basic examples of test cases for the Bitcoin token envelope logic. You may want to consider additional edge cases and error scenarios, such as invalid input parameters, insufficient funds, and incorrect signatures or script pubkeys.

### Unit Tests

Sure, here are detailed unit tests for the first 3 test cases:

1. Test the `createToken` function:

```
describe("createToken", () => {
  it("should create a new token with the specified attributes and add it to the token supply", () => {

    const tokenEnvelope = new BitcoinTokenEnvelope();
    tokenEnvelope.createToken(tokenID, "Test Token", "TT", 8, senderPublicKey);
    tokenEnvelope.mint(tokenID, senderPublicKey, 1000);

    // Act
    const result = tokenEnvelope.transfer(tokenID, recipientPublicKey, amount, senderPrivateKey, senderPublicKey);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(true);
    expect(tokenEnvelope.getBalance(tokenID, senderPublicKey)).toBe(900);
    expect(tokenEnvelope.getBalance(tokenID, recipientPublicKey)).toBe(amount);
  });
});
```

3. Test the `balanceOf` function:

```

    const publicKey = "02a1d8a68f2e52a3a701d0cf0503c187d5b0d82d01e7dd4d6d3d87ac80b937a842";
    const tokenEnvelope = new BitcoinTokenEnvelope();
    tokenEnvelope.createToken(tokenID, "Test Token", "TT", 8, publicKey);
