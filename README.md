# BRC20-SwapContract
gua & karuna

##### This is an open source smart contract for a BRC20 liquidity pool on bitcoin written in Miniscript. It has been written by ChatGPT and I.

All that's needed (for now) is in the [Documentation folder](https://github.com/DanM3rcurius/BRC20-SwapContract/tree/main/Documentation),

LET'S BUILD!

**HOLD ON**

I was made aware of BRC20s shortcomings and am now trying to create a new envelope together with ChatGPT, it can be found here:
